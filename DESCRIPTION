    Multivariate Process Monitoring
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Gabriel Odom, Ben Barnard, Karen Kazor, and Amanda Hering
Maintainer: Gabriel Odom <gabriel_odom@baylor.edu>
Description: Use multi-state splitting to apply Adaptive-Dynamic PCA to data
    generated from a continuous-time multivariate industrial or natural process.
    Employ PCA-based dimension reduction to extract linear combinations of
    relevant features, reducing computational burdens.
