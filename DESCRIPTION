Title: Multi-State Adaptive Dynamic Principal Component Analysis for
  Multivariate Process Monitoring
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Gabriel Odom, Ben Barnard, Karen Kazor, and Amanda Hering
Maintainer: Gabriel Odom <gabriel_odom@baylor.edu>
Description: Use multi-state splitting to apply Adaptive-Dynamic PCA to data
  generated from a continuous-time multivariate industrial or natural process. 
  Employ PCA-based dimension reduction to extract linear combinations of 
  relevant features, reducing computational burdens.
