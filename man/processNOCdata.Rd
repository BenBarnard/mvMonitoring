\title{Simulate NOC Observations from a Single-State or Multi-State Process}
\usage{
processNOCdata(startTime, period = 7 * 24 * 60, stateDuration = 60,
  increment = "min", multiState = TRUE, angles2 = list(yaw = 0, pitch =
  90, roll = 30), scales2 = c(1, 0.5, 2), angles3 = list(yaw = 90, pitch =
  0, roll = -30), scales3 = c(0.25, 0.1, 0.75), autocorellation = 0.75,
  tLower = 0.01, tUpper = 2, errVar = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{startTime}{a POSIXct object specifying the day and time for the
starting observation.}

\item{period}{The observation cycle length. Defaults to one week's worth of
minute-level observations (10,080 observations).}

\item{stateDuration}{The number of observations generated during a stay in
each state. Defaults to 60.}

\item{increment}{The time-sequence base increment. See "Deatails" of the
seq.POSIXt() function options. Defaults to "min" for minutes.}

\item{multiState}{Should the observations be generated from a multi-state
process? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{angles2}{Change the principal angles for State 2. Defaults to yaw = 0,
pitch = 90, and roll = 30.}

\item{scales2}{Change the principal scales for State 2. Defaults to 1, 0.5,
and 2.}

\item{angles3}{Change the principal angles for State 3. Defaults to yaw = 90,
pitch = 0, and roll = -30.}

\item{scales3}{Change the principal scales for State 3. Defaults to 0.25,
0.1, and 0.75.}

\item{autocorellation}{The autocorrelation parameter. Must be less than 1 in
absolute value, or the process generated will be nonstationary. Defaults to
0.75 in accordance to Kazor et al (2016).}

\item{tLower}{Lower bound of the latent $t$ variable. Defaults to 0.01.}

\item{tUpper}{Upper bound of the latent $t$ variable. Defaults to 2.}

\item{errVar}{Error variance of the normal white noise process on the feature
variables.}
}
\value{
An data frame with the following information: \itemize{
  \item{dateTime -- }{A POSIXct column of times starting at the user-defined
  `startTime` argument, length given by the `period` argument, and spacing
  given by the `increment` argument. For example, if the starting value is
  "2016-01-10", period is 10080, and the incrementation is in minutes, then
  this sequence will be one week's worth of observations recorded every
  minute from midnight on the tenth of January.} \item{state -- }{An integer
  column of all 1's (when the `multiState` argument is FALSE), or a column of
  the state values (1, 2 or 3).} \item{x -- }{A double column of generated
  values for the first feature.} \item{y -- }{A double column of generated
  values for the second feature.} \item{z -- }{A double column of generated
  values for the third feature.}}

\description{
This function generates data under normal operating conditions
  from a single-state or multi-state process model.
